## Oversampling research

## TODO:
- [x] Draw graphs of Gamma Distribution in Desmos, examine parameters

https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gxk5zydswy

As a test values `k=1` and `thehta=3` will be taken 

- [x] How to make random variable with Gamma Distribution


Available in `Research Gamma Dist.ipynb`
However still question about section, because Gamma distribution generates random variable on [0;+oo] meanwhile we need only for [0;1]

- [x] How to generate random variable with Gamma Distribution on a section

- [x] Generate new point for two points on 2D

- [x] Generate multiple points for two points on 2D

- [x] Visualization for above on 2D

- [x] Write test function for testing whether three points are on one line or not

- [x] Generate new point for two points for n dimentional space

- [ ] Generate multiple points for two points for n dimentional space

- [ ] Generalize this approach for n minority points for n dimentional space

## Issues:

`from imblearn.datasets import fetch_datasets` does not work for me as inside it fails in importing `from sklearn.utils.fixes import makedirs`
