## Oversampling research

## TODO:
- [x] Draw graphs of Gamma Distribution in Desmos, examine parameters

https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gxk5zydswy

As a test values `k=1` and `thehta=3` will be taken 

- [x] How to make random variable with Gamma Distribution


Available in `Research Gamma Dist.ipynb`
However still question about section, because Gamma distribution generates random variable on [0;+oo] meanwhile we need only for [0;1]

- [x] How to generate random variable with Gamma Distribution on a section

- [x] Generate new point for two points on 2D

- [x] Generate multiple points for two points on 2D

- [x] Visualization for above on 2D

- [x] Write test function for testing whether three points are on one line or not

- [x] Generate new point for two points for n dimentional space

- [x] Generate multiple points for two points for n dimentional space

- [x] Generalize this approach for n minority points for n dimentional space

Currently: randomly choose any two minority points, generate new point on the line between than. Repeat this process n times. Selected pair of minority points can repeat

- [x] Implement another approach for Gamma distribution when there is probability to generate new point on the other side

- [ ] Add cross-validation

- [ ] Add loop over all datasets and creating resulting DataFrame

- [ ] Debug code to check the quality improvement 

- [ ] Add realisation of SMOTE in order to compare

- [ ] Add to statistics dataframe number of elements and percantage of minority class

## Possible issues:

1. 

Problem:
`from imblearn.datasets import fetch_datasets` does not work for me as inside it fails in importing `from sklearn.utils.fixes import makedirs`

Solution:
Forcing `pip install imbalanced-learn==0.5.0`. The problem was observed on 0.4 version
